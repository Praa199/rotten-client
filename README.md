## Rotten Potatos

## Components v Pages

Even though both are going be constructed as `components`. I want to have a clear split (in terms of mental picture) between what we call a component and a page in this application

### Pages & Routes

/ HomePage Page
/login LoginPage Page
/signup SignupPage Page
/profile ProfilePage Page
/movies MoviesPage Page
/movies? SearchMovies Page
/movies/add Add Movies Page
/movies/:id/edit Edit Movies Page
/movies/:id SingleMovies Page
/:username SingleUserProfile Page
NOT FOUND

### Data necessary for each page

ALL OVER -> if logged in -> `DELETE` request for logout

/ -> user info (to check if you're logged in or not) // user from DB
/login -> to be able to send POST request
/signup -> to be able to send POST request
/profile -> user info and be able to send `PUT`/`PATCH`, `DELETE`, or `POST`
/movies -> a list of movies
/movies? -> list of movies filtered
/movies/add -> `POST` request to create movie
/movies/:id/edit -> `PUT` request to update a single movie
/movies/:id -> `GET` request to get single movie. `POST` request to create review. `PUT` request to edit a review
/:username -> `GET` request to get single user info
